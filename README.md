## üß™ Recommended Practices

- Keep each plugin self-contained (no shared global state).
- Store shared helper functions in a `common/` folder if needed.
- Exclude caches, compiled `.pyc`, and workspace files in `.gitignore`.
- Use clear and consistent naming:
  `plugin_name.py` and `plugin_name.sublime-settings`.
